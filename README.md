Project 2: Mayor for a day game(Housing Policy)

Hello World!Desiree Cele built this Housing Policy Game to show how coding can help solve real city problems. 
Using simple Python(using only random and simple Input/Output), the program lets you play as a Mayor choosing policies 
to make homes more affordable - with each decision changing the results. As you play, you'll learn how basic programming can create useful tools for understanding housing challenges.
NB. This program demonstrates how even basic Python skills can automate housing market analysis,model policy outcomes,
generate data-driven recommendations and visualize complex trends in a simple way.
