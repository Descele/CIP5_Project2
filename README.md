# CIP5_Project2
Code In Place-Stanford University
Project 2: Mayor for a day game(Housing Policy Simulator)

Stanford University‚Äôs Code in Place‚Äîa global initiative inspired by CS 106A‚Äîequipped me with rigorous Python foundations through project-based learning. These projects reflect how I bridge code and urban analysis, transforming abstract concepts into tools for spatial problem-solving.

As an urban planner, I designed solutions that demonstrate Python‚Äôs versatility: automating workflows, analyzing datasets, and visualizing urban patterns. Each project here began as a technical exercise but evolved into a lens for interdisciplinary thinking.

Urban Governance Meets Python Game Design

This interactive CLI game‚Äîbuilt with only Python‚Äôs random and basic I/O‚Äîdemonstrates how simple code can model complex urban systems. As mayor of "Tinyville," players balance housing policies while seeing real-time impacts on affordability, mirroring the tradeoffs city planners face daily. Simple math reveals real tradeoffs: more homes might not always mean affordability. This project taught me how to turn complex urban economics into an interactive game.

Key Features:
üèòPolicy Sandbox ‚Äì Choose 2 of 4 housing interventions (transit upgrades, rent control, etc.)
üìà Dynamic Outcomes ‚Äì Randomized but realistic impacts on home prices/availability
üí∞ Affordability Metrics ‚Äì Tracks price-to-income ratios before/after decisions
üñ•Ô∏è Minimalist Design ‚Äì Pure Python (no dependencies) with colorful CLI formatting

Technical Highlights:
Clean policy impact modeling with random ranges
Interactive menus with input validation
Visualized data comparisons (before/after tables)

Sample Output:
‚òÖ Before vs After ‚òÖ
| Homes:        |  1,200 ‚Üí  1,350 (+150)
| Home Price:   | $450,000 ‚Üí $382,500
| Affordability: |     6.5x ‚Üí     5.5x salary
