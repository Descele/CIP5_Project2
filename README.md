Code In Place-Stanford University
Project 2: Mayor for a day game(Housing Policy Simulator)

Stanford University’s Code in Place—a global initiative inspired by CS 106A—equipped me with rigorous Python foundations through project-based learning. These projects reflect how I bridge code and urban analysis, transforming abstract concepts into tools for spatial problem-solving.

As an urban planner, I designed solutions that demonstrate Python’s versatility: automating workflows, analyzing datasets, and visualizing urban patterns. Each project here began as a technical exercise but evolved into a lens for interdisciplinary thinking—proof that programming isn’t just for engineers, but for anyone shaping cities.

Urban Governance Meets Python Game Design

This interactive CLI game—built with only Python’s random and basic I/O—demonstrates how simple code can model complex urban systems. As mayor of "Tinyville," players balance housing policies while seeing real-time impacts on affordability, mirroring the tradeoffs city planners face daily.

Key Features:
🏘Policy Sandbox – Choose 2 of 4 housing interventions (transit upgrades, rent control, etc.)
📈 Dynamic Outcomes – Randomized but realistic impacts on home prices/availability
💰 Affordability Metrics – Tracks price-to-income ratios before/after decisions
🖥️ Minimalist Design – Pure Python (no dependencies) with colorful CLI formatting

Technical Highlights:
Clean policy impact modeling with random ranges
Interactive menus with input validation
Visualized data comparisons (before/after tables)
